# Intro
Security Champions Playbook is a project started in preparation for the presentation ["Security Champions 2.0"](https://www.owasp.org/images/3/3c/OWASP_Bucharest_2017_Antukh.pdf) at OWASP Bucharest AppSec Conference 2017. It describes the main steps for fast establishment of a Security Champions program regardless of the company size and maturity of the existing security processes.


# Who are the Security Champions?
According to OWASP definition, Security Champions are "active members of a team that may help to make decisions about when to engage the Security Team". They act as a core element of security assurance process within the product or service, and hold the role of the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) within the team.

# What benefits do Champions bring to my company?
Main advantages of having a team of Security Champions:
* Scaling security through multiple teams
* Engaging "non-security" folks
* Establishing the security culture
