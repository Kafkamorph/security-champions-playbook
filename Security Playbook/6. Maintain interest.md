# 6. Maintain interest
In order to have a continuous and successful Security Champions ecosystem, it's
crucial to constantly support them and provide with learning materials. Below you
can find several ways to maintain Champions' interest and help them evolve as
security professionals.

## Workshops & trainings
Conduct periodic workshops for the teams, explain the strategy, promote best practices,
or just share some recent news from the security world. Organize an [interactive quiz](https://kahoot.com), announce Hacker Thursday or start a ["Month of bugs"](https://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Security-Crowdsourcing/Internal-Bug-Bounties-Programmes.html).
Talk to the Champions and together decide what format is the most suitable for you.
No matter what format you're going to choose, it's probably the most important
point throughout the whole Playbook. Keep them motivated, and you'll be pleasantly
surprised very soon!

## Regular newsletters
Share recent security news via established communication channels (such as [Ezine weekly appsec compilations](https://github.com/Simpsonpt/AppSecEzine)). Additionally, start
monthly security newsletters with updates from the teams, plans, recognitions for
the good work and any other relevant and interesting information - this won't only
engage Champions even more but will be a good checkpoint, also for your security
program.

## Security Champions corner
Create a separate space in your internal wiki and add there dedicated pages such as:
- conference calendar ([start here](https://infosec-conferences.com))
- security library of good books and articles ([start here](https://github.com/paragonie/awesome-appsec))
- slides from attended conferences (or [start here](https://github.com/PaulSec/awesome-sec-talks))
- "rooms for ideas and improvement"

## Local OWASP meetings
Start a local chapter or [join an existing one](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Chapter),
and invite Champions to learn and share! This is one more great way to socialize,
meet with peers and discuss actual problems, news and ideas.
