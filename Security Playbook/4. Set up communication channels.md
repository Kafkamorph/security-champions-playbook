# 4. Set up communication channels
Nominated Champions cannot operate on their own, and it works best when they
really feel the (meta) team spirit - so the next step would be to set up
communication channels. Depending on the corporate culture, it could be e.g. the
following:

- private Slack / IRC channels
- Keybase teams
- Skype group chats
- Yammer groups
- mailing lists

The more the better, really - just make sure there is an easy way to spread
important information and get feedback. Additionally, set up periodic sync ups
to see how things are going, and to adjust short-term goals together. For the
beginning, bi-weekly meetings should do fine.
