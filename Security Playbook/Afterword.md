# Afterword
If you followed all the steps, you should by now have a working Security Champions
program. I've tried to outline the most important phases in order to achieve
the best results, although it might be possible to get the same by skipping or
reordering phases.

The best about the Champions ecosystem is not just scalability but the "side benefits"
your organization is getting, the main of which is development of a security culture. With time,
they will start to propose their own initiatives, participate in R&D and conduct
product-specific workshops, engaging more and more people and making security
"everyone's business", as it should be.
