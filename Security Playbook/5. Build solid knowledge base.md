# 5. Build solid knowledge base
Main idea here: internal knowledge base should be the primary source of answers
for security-related questions. Apart from the meta-team page, which allows anyone
to quickly find the right contact, the following pages will prove themselves quite
helpful:
- Global security strategy
- Clearly defined security roles and procedures
- Secure development best practices
- Recommended crypto algorithms
- Description of common risks & vulnerabilities
- Password policies

Special attention should be paid to simple and easy-to-follow checklists, as
it's usually the simplest way to get the things going. Sample checklists might
include the following:
- Web / mobile security checklists
- Third-party security checklist
- UI security checklist
- Privacy checklist

While it can be a tedious task to create everything from the scratch, there is a
number of open-source projects, which can make your life much easier. OWASP projects
such as [Security Knowledge Framework](https://www.securityknowledgeframework.org),
[ASVS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project)
and [MASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs) as well as industry best
practices (e.g. [CERT secure coding standards](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/SEI+CERT+Coding+Standards))
will be an excellent starting point to boost your KB and could become your basis
for the first several internal workshops.
